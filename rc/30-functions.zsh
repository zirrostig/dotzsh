    # The globbing is a little complicated here:
    # - '#q' is an explicit glob qualifier that makes globbing work within zsh's [[ ]] construct.
    # - 'N' makes the glob pattern evaluate to nothing when it doesn't match (rather than throw a globbing error)
    # - '.' matches "regular files"
    # - 'mh+24' matches files (or directories or whatever) that are older than 24 hours.
